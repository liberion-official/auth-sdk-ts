Add standalone UMD bundle for browser usage

The package now includes a standalone UMD bundle (`lib/liberion-auth.js`) that can be used directly in browsers without build tools. The bundle is:

- Available via NPM CDN: unpkg.com and jsdelivr.net
- Included in GitHub Releases as downloadable asset

This enables easy integration with WordPress, static sites, and other non-build-tool environments.
